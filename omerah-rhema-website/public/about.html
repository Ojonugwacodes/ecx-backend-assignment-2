  <h1>About Backend Development</h1>

  <p>
    Backend development is the part of a website or application that works
    behind the scenes. It handles things users do not see, like storing data,
    processing requests, and making sure everything works correctly.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you log in to a website, submit a form, or see your data saved,
    backend development is what makes that happen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Backend developers work with servers, databases, and APIs to make sure
    the application is fast, secure, and reliable.
